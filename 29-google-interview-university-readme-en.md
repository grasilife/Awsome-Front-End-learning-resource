## What is it?

This is my multi-month study plan for going from web developer (self-taught, no CS degree) to Google software engineer.

![Coding at the whiteboard - from HBO's Silicon Valley](https://dng5l3qzreal6.cloudfront.net/2016/Aug/coding_board_small-1470866369118.jpg)

This long list has been extracted and expanded from **Google's coaching notes**, so these are the things you need to know. 
There are extra items I added at the bottom that may come up in the interview or be helpful in solving a problem. Many items are from 
Steve Yegge's "[Get that job at Google](c-users-fuguo-appdata-local-temp-gitbook2lark-153a3022d07bea00fb)" and are reflected 
sometimes word-for-word in Google's coaching notes.

## Why use it?

I'm following this plan to prepare for my Google interview. I've been building the web, building
services, and launching startups since 1997. I have an economics degree, not a CS degree.  I've
been very successful in my career, but I want to work at Google. I want to progress into larger systems
and get a real understanding of computer systems, algorithmic efficiency, data structure performance,
low-level languages, and how it all works. And if you don't know any of it, Google won't hire you.

When I started this project, I didn't know a stack from a heap, didn't know Big-O anything, anything about trees, or how to
traverse a graph. If I had to code a sorting algorithm, I can tell ya it wouldn't have been very good.
Every data structure I've ever used was built into the language, and I didn't know how they worked
under the hood at all. I've never had to manage memory, unless a process I was running would give an "out of
memory" error, and then I'd have to find a workaround. I've used a few multi-dimensional arrays in my life and
thousands of associative arrays, but I've never created data structures from scratch.

But after going through this study plan I have high confidence I'll be hired. It's a long plan. It's going to take me
months. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.

## How to use it

Everything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom.

I'm using Github's special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to check progress.

- [x] Create a new branch so you can check items like this, just put an x in the brackets: [x]

[More about Github-flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown)

## Get in a Googley Mood

Print out a "[future Googler](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university/blob/master/extras/future-googler.pdf)" sign (or two) and keep your eyes on the prize.

[![future Googler sign](https://dng5l3qzreal6.cloudfront.net/2016/Oct/Screen_Shot_2016_10_04_at_10_13_24_AM-1475601104364.png)](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university/blob/master/extras/future-googler.pdf)

## Did I Get the Job?

I haven't applied yet.

I still have a few days in the learning phase (finishing up this crazy list), and starting next week all 
I'll be doing is programming questions all day long. That will continue for a few weeks, and then I'll
apply through a referral I've been holding onto since February (yes, February).

    Thanks for the referral, JP.

## About Video Resources

Some videos are available only by enrolling in a Coursera, EdX, or Lynda.com class. These are called MOOCs.
It is free to do so, but sometimes the classes are not in session so you have to wait a couple of months, so you have no access. 

    I'd appreciate your help converting the MOOC video links to public sources to replace the online course videos over time. I like using university lectures.

## Pick One Language for the Interview

I wrote this short article about it: [Important: Pick One Language for the Google Interview](https://googleyasheck.com/important-pick-one-language-for-the-google-interview/)

You can use a language you are comfortable in to do the coding part of the interview, but for Google, these are solid choices:

- C++
- Java
- Python

You could also use these, but read around first. There may be caveats:

- JavaScript
- Ruby

You need to be very comfortable in the language, and be knowledgeable. 

Read more about choices:
- http://www.byte-by-byte.com/choose-the-right-language-for-your-coding-interview/
- http://blog.codingforinterviews.com/best-programming-language-jobs/
- https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-language-to-program-in-for-an-in-person-Google-interview

[See language resources here](programming-language-resources.md)

You'll see some C, C++, and Python learning included below, because I'm learning. There are a few books involved, see the bottom.

## Before you Get Started

This list grew over many months, and yes, it kind of got out of hand. 

Here are some mistakes I made so you'll have a better experience.

### 1. You Won't Remember it All

I watched hours of videos and took copious notes, and months later there was much I didn't remember. I spent 3 days going 
through my notes and making flashcards so I could review (see below). 

### 2. Use Flashcards

To solve the problem, I made a little flashcards site where I could add flashcards of 2 types: general and code.
Each card has different formatting.

I made a mobile-first website so I could review on my phone and tablet, whereever I am.

Make your own for free:

- [Flashcards site repo](https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards)
- [My flash cards database](https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards/blob/master/cards-jwasham.db): Keep in mind I went overboard and have cards covering everything from assembly language and Python trivia to machine learning and statistics. It's way too much for what's required by Google.

**Note on flashcards:** The first time you recognize you know the answer, don't mark it as known. You have to see the 
same card and answer it several times correctly before you really know it. Repetition will put that knowledge deeper in 
your brain.

### 3. Review, review, review

I keep a set of cheatsheets on ASCII, OSI stack, Big-O notations, and more. I study them when I have some spare time.

Take a break from programming problems for a half hour and go through your flashcards.

### 4. Focus

There are a lot of distractions that can take up valuable time. Focus and concentration is hard.

## What you won't see covered

This big list all started as a personal to-do list made from Google interview coaching notes. These are prevalent 
technologies but were not mentioned in those notes:

- SQL
- Javascript
- HTML, CSS, and other front-end technologies

## The Daily Plan

Some subjects take one day, and some will take multiple days. Some are just learning with nothing to implement.

Each day I take one subject from the list below, watch videos about that subject, and write an implementation in:
    C - using structs and functions that take a struct * and something else as args.
    C++ - without using built-in types
    C++ - using built-in types, like STL's std::list for a linked list
    Python - using built-in types (to keep practicing Python)
    and write tests to ensure I'm doing it right, sometimes just using simple assert() statements
    You may do Java or something else, this is just my thing.

Why code in all of these?
    Practice, practice, practice, until I'm sick of it, and can do it with no problem (some have many edge cases and bookkeeping details to remember)
    Work within the raw constraints (allocating/freeing memory without help of garbage collection (except Python))
    Make use of built-in types so I have experience using the built-in tools for real-world use (not going to write my own linked list implementation in production)

I may not have time to do all of these for every subject, but I'll try.

You can see my code here:
 - [C] (https://github.com/jwasham/practice-c)
 - [C++] (https://github.com/jwasham/practice-cpp)
 - [Python] (https://github.com/jwasham/practice-python)

You don't need to memorize the guts of every algorithm.

Write code on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer. Test with some sample inputs. Then test it out on a computer.

## Data Structures

- ### Arrays
    - Implement an automatically resizing vector.
    - [ ] Description:
        - [Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/OsBSF/arrays)
        - [Basic Arrays (video)](c-users-fuguo-appdata-local-temp-gitbook2lark-153a3022d07bea00fb)
        - [Multi-dim (video)](c-users-fuguo-appdata-local-temp-gitbook2lark-153a3022d07bea00fb)

        - [Jagged Arrays (video)](c-users-fuguo-appdata-local-temp-gitbook2lark-153a3022d07bea00fb)
        - [Resizing arrays (video)](c-users-fuguo-appdata-local-temp-gitbook2lark-153a3022d07bea00fb)
    - [ ] Implement a vector (mutable array with automatic resizing):
        - [ ] Practice coding using arrays and pointers, and pointer math to jump to an index instead of using indexing.
        - [ ] new raw data array with allocated memory
            - can allocate int array under the hood, just not use its features
            - start with 16, or if starting number is greater, use power of 2 - 16, 32, 64, 128
        - [ ] size() - number of items
        - [ ] capacity() - number of items it can hold
        - [ ] is_empty()
        - [ ] at(index) - returns item at given index, blows up if index out of bounds
        - [ ] push(item)
        - [ ] insert(index, item) - inserts item at index, shifts that index's value and trailing elements to the right
        - [ ] prepend(item) - can use insert above at index 0
        - [ ] pop() - remove from end, return value
        - [ ] delete(index) - delete item at index, shifting all trailing elements left
        - [ ] remove(item) - looks for value and removes index holding it (even if in multiple places)
        - [ ] find(item) - looks for value and returns first index with that value, -1 if not found
        - [ ] resize(new_capacity) // private function
            - when you reach capacity, resize to double the size
            - when popping an item, if size is 1/4 of capacity, resize to half
    - [ ] Time
        - O(1) to add/remove at end (amortized for allocations for more space), index, or update
        - O(n) to insert/remove elsewhere
    - [ ] Space
        - contiguous in memory, so proximity helps performance
        - space needed = (array capacity, which is >= n) * size of item, but even if 2n, still O(n)

- ### Linked Lists
    - [ ] Description:
        - [ ] [Singly Linked Lists (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/kHhgK/singly-linked-lists)
        - [ ] [CS 61B - Linked Lists (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJtJOtXCW_M&list=PL-XXv-cvA_iAlnI-BQr9hjqADPBtujFJd&index=5)
    - [ ] [C Code (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN6FPiD0Gzo)
            - not the whole video, just portions about Node struct and memory allocation.
    - [ ] Linked List vs Arrays:
        - [Core Linked Lists Vs Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance/lecture/rjBs9/core-linked-lists-vs-arrays)
        - [In The Real World Linked Lists Vs Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance/lecture/QUaUd/in-the-real-world-lists-vs-arrays)
    - [ ] [why you should avoid linked lists (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo)
    - [ ] Gotcha: you need pointer to pointer knowledge:
        (for when you pass a pointer to a function that may change the address where that pointer points)
        This page is just to get a grasp on ptr to ptr. I don't recommend this list traversal style. Readability and maintainability suffer due to cleverness.
        - [Pointers to Pointers](c-users-fuguo-appdata-local-temp-gitbook2lark-153a3022d07bea00fb)
    - [ ] implement (I did with tail pointer & without):
        - [ ] size() - returns number of data elements in list
        - [ ] empty() - bool returns true if empty
        - [ ] value_at(index) - returns the value of the nth item (starting at 0 for first)
        - [ ] push_front(value) - adds an item to the front of the list

        - No need to implement

    - [ ] Implement using linked-list, with tail pointer:
        - enqueue(value) - adds value at position at tail
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element (front)
        - empty()
    - [ ] Implement using fixed-sized array:
        - enqueue(value) - adds item at end of available storage
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element
        - empty()
        - full()
    - [ ] Cost:
        - a bad implementation using linked list where you enqueue at head and dequeue at tail would be O(n)
            because you'd need the next to last element, causing a full traversal each dequeue
        - enqueue: O(1) (amortized, linked list and array [probing])
        - dequeue: O(1) (linked list and array)
        - empty: O(1) (linked list and array)

- ### Balanced search trees
    - Know least one type of balanced binary tree (and know how it's implemented):
    - "Among balanced search trees, AVL and 2/3 trees are now passé, and red-black trees seem to be more popular.
        A particularly interesting self-organizing data structure is the splay tree, which uses rotations
        to move any accessed key to the root." - Skiena
    - Of these, I chose to implement a splay tree. From what I've read, you won't implement a
        balanced search tree in your interview. But I wanted exposure to coding one up
        and let's face it, splay trees are the bee's knees. I did read a lot of red-black tree code.
        - splay tree: insert, search, delete functions
        If you end up implementing red/black tree try just these:
        - search and insertion functions, skipping delete
    - I want to learn more about B-Tree since it's used so widely with very large data sets.
    - [ ] [Self-balancing binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree)

    - [ ] **AVL trees**
        - In practice:
            From what I can tell, these aren't used much in practice, but I could see where they would be:
            The AVL tree is another structure supporting O(log n) search, insertion, and removal. It is more rigidly
            balanced than red–black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval. This makes it
            attractive for data structures that may be built once and loaded without reconstruction, such as language
            dictionaries (or program dictionaries, such as the opcodes of an assembler or interpreter).

        - In practice:
            Splay trees are typically used in the implementation of caches, memory allocators, routers, garbage collectors,
            data compression, ropes (replacement of string used for long text strings), in Windows NT (in the virtual memory,
            networking, and file system code) etc.

    - [ ] **2-3 search trees**
        - In practice:
            2-3 trees have faster inserts at the expense of slower searches (since height is more compared to AVL trees).
        - You would use 2-3 tree very rarely because its implementation involves different types of nodes. Instead, people use Red Black trees.

    - [ ] **2-3-4 Trees (aka 2-4 trees)**
        - In practice:
            For every 2-4 tree, there are corresponding red–black trees with data elements in the same order. The insertion and deletion
            operations on 2-4 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in red–black trees. This makes 2-4 trees an
            important tool for understanding the logic behind red–black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce
            2-4 trees just before red–black trees, even though **2-4 trees are not often used in practice**.

            its use in databases, the B-tree is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary
            block in a particular file. The basic problem is turning the file block i address into a disk block
            (or perhaps to a cylinder-head-sector) address.

    - [ ] **Red/black trees**
        - In practice:
            Red–black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time.
            Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications,
            but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures which provide worst-case guarantees;
            for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red–black trees, and
            the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses red–black trees. In the version 8 of Java,
            the Collection HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store identical elements with poor
            hashcodes, a Red-Black tree is used.

## Graphs

Graphs can be used to represent many problems in computer science, so this section is long, like trees and sorting were.

- Notes from Yegge:
    - There are three basic ways to represent a graph in memory:
        - objects and pointers
        - matrix
        - adjacency list
    - Familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons
    - BFS and DFS - know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code
    - When asked a question, look for a graph-based solution first, then move on if none.

    Scalability and System Design are very large topics with many topics and resources, since there is a lot to consider 
    when designing a software/hardware system that can scale. Expect to spend quite a bit of time on this.

- ### System Design, Scalability, Data Handling
    - Considerations from Yegge:
        - scalability
            - Distill large data sets to single values
            - Transform one data set to another
            - Handling obscenely large amounts of data
        - system design
            - features sets
            - interfaces
            - class hierarchies
            - designing a system under certain constraints
            - simplicity and robustness
            - tradeoffs
            - performance analysis and optimization

    - [ ] Practicing the system design process: Here are some ideas to try working through on paper, each with some documentation on how it was handled in the real world:
        - review: [System Design from HiredInTech](http://www.hiredintech.com/system-design/)
        - [cheat sheet](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university/blob/master/extras/cheat%20sheets/system-design.pdf)
        - flow:
            1. Understand the problem and scope:
                - define the use cases, with interviewer's help
                - suggest additional features
                - remove items that interviewer deems out of scope
                - assume high availability is required, add as a use case
            2. Think about constraints:
                - ask how many requests per month
                - ask how many requests per second (they may volunteer it or make you do the math)
                - estimate reads vs. writes percentage
                - keep 80/20 rule in mind when estimating
                - how much data written per second
                - total storage required over 5 years
                - how much data read per second
            3. Abstract design:
                - layers (service, data, caching)
                - infrastructure: load balancing, messaging
                - rough overview of any key algorithm that drives the service
                - consider bottlenecks and determine solutions

## Coding Question Practice

Now that you know all the computer science topics above, it's time to practice answering coding problems.

**Coding question practice is not about memorizing answers to programming problems.**

Why you need to practice doing programming problems:
- problem recognition, and where the right data structures and algorithms fit in
- gathering requirements for the problem
- talking your way through the problem like you will in the interview
- coding on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer
- coming up with time and space complexity for your solutions
- testing your solutions

There is a great intro for methodical, communicative problem solving in an interview. You'll get this from the programming 
interview books, too, but I found this outstanding:
- [ ] [Algorithm design canvas](http://www.hiredintech.com/algorithm-design/)

No whiteboard at home? That makes sense. I'm a weirdo and have a big whiteboard. Instead of a whiteboard, pick up a 
large drawing pad from an art store. You can sit on the couch and practice. This is my "sofa whiteboard". 
I added the pen in the photo for scale.

![my sofa whiteboard](https://dng5l3qzreal6.cloudfront.net/2016/Oct/art_board_sm_2-1476233630368.jpg)

- [Mathematics for Topcoders](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/mathematics-for-topcoders/)
- [Dynamic Programming – From Novice to Advanced](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/dynamic-programming-from-novice-to-advanced/)

- [Exercises for getting better at a given language](http://exercism.io/languages)

**Read as a review and problem recognition**
- [ ] [Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202) (Skiena)
    - To quote Yegge: "More than any other book it helped me understand just how astonishingly commonplace 
        (and important) graph problems are – they should be part of every working programmer's toolkit. The book also 
        covers basic data structures and sorting algorithms, which is a nice bonus. But the gold mine is the second half 
        of the book, which is a sort of encyclopedia of 1-pagers on zillions of useful problems and various ways to solve 
        them, without too much detail. Almost every 1-pager has a simple picture, making it easy to remember. This is a 
        great way to learn how to identify hundreds of problem types."
    - Can rent it on kindle
    - Half.com is a great resource for textbooks at good prices.

- [ ] [Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job, 2nd Edition](c-users-fuguo-appdata-local-temp-gitbook2lark-153a3022d07bea00fb)
    - recommended in Google candidate coaching
- [ ] [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/)
    - recommended on the [Google Careers site](https://www.google.com/about/careers/how-we-hire/interview/)
    - If you see people reference "The Google Resume", it was a book replaced by "Cracking the Coding Interview".

**If you have time**

- [ ] [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844)
    - To quote Yegge: "But if you want to come into your interviews *prepped*, then consider deferring your application until you've made your way through that book."
    - Half.com is a great resource for textbooks at good prices.
    - aka CLR, sometimes CLRS, because Stein was late to the game
- [ ] [Elements of Programming Interviews](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836)
    - all code is in C++, if you're looking to use C++ in your interview
    - good book on problem solving in general.

## Be thinking of for when the interview comes

Think of about 20 interview questions you'll get, along the lines of the items below. Have 2-3 answers for each.
Have a story, not just data, about something you accomplished.

- Why do you want this job?
- What's a tough problem you've solved?
- Biggest challenges faced?
- Best/worst designs seen?
- Ideas for improving an existing Google product.
- How do you work best, as an individual and as part of a team?
- Which of your skills or experiences would be assets in the role and why?
- What did you most enjoy at [job x / project y]?
- What was the biggest challenge you faced at [job x / project y]?
- What was the hardest bug you faced at [job x / project y]?
- What did you learn at [job x / project y]?
- What would you have done better at [job x / project y]?

## Have questions for the interviewer

    Some of mine (I already may know answer to but want their opinion or team perspective):

- How large is your team?
- What is your dev cycle look like? Do you do waterfall/sprints/agile?
- Are rushes to deadlines common? Or is there flexibility?
- How are decisions made in your team?
- How many meetings do you have per week?
- Do you feel your work environment helps you concentrate?
- What are you working on?
- What do you like about it?
- What is the work life like?

## Once You've Got The Job

Congratulations!

Keep learning.

You're never really done.
